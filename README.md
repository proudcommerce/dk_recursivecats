Recursive Categories module for OXID eShop 6.x.
For lower OXID eShop Versions view the original [git by Christian Neumann](https://github.com/chrneumann/dk_recursivecats)

!! Development version, don't use in production !!
TODO: Bugfixing, check session filters (possibly won't work yet).

This module changes the default OXID eShop behaviour to list products of a
chosen category including the products in its subcategories.

The module is based on ideas posted in the OXID Community Forum (german):
